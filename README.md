# Office-database-manager
A simple sales, jobs, staff and inventory database manager for a solar company
This project was made to aid a secretary for a company that deals with sales, installation and maintenance of inverters and solar panels.
Staff, Inventory, Sales, and Jobs can be added, updated and removed. 
A report can be generated and filtered according to various parameters. Excel files containing the filtered reports can also be generated. 
A reminder appears for refilling of batteries' distilled water and for maintenance of panel installations.
